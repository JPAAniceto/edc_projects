TP2 - EDC

This work will focus more on companies and showing their info. Companies values and buy/sell will be out/stripped. Given the use of rdf, this will be more appropriate and easier to perform.
My Portfolio will be replaced by a page that shows the companies/ceo's favorited by a user. 
Coin selector will use a API specified below.
All values (total revenue only) will be adjusted to usd$ in DB.
We'll try to reuse TP1 as much as possible, mostly frontend.

Main features:
	See companies and their info
	Sort though them with advanced menu search
	Favorite company page so you can't lose it
	Dynamically fill info from Wikidata when admin tries to add company
	Graphs for the total revenue by year for each company
	Ability for the admin to add/edit/delete company from DB

Page changes/updates:
Home:
	Tables are replaced by a single table with top total revenue for 2017
Values (possibly requires name change):
	Page that has a search = companiesSearch/filter, and the result shows a bar graph of the total revenue for 2017/company
Companies:
	Search/filter by with an advanced menu:
		Industria
		CEO
		Founded by
		Founding year
		Country
		Total Revenue (2017)
CompaniesInfo:
	Graph shows total revenue/year
	Show star if user logged in to favorite company or CEO
	Show edit/delete button if user is admin
CEOinfo
    Show star if user logged in to favorite company or CEO
	Show edit/delete button if user is admin
My Profile(Portfolio):
	Shows name, favorite pages and CEO's with button to unfavorite
Admin page:
	Add company - User writes symbol, app fills the rest of the form with data from wikidata. User can change it before submitting
	Remove company - Button to this page appears on each companyInfo page, and goes to a page where a form is already filled in.
	Edit Company - Button to this page appears on each companyInfo page, and goes to a page where a form is already filled in.
